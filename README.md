# DataPuzzle

DataPuzzle proposed a mechanism with an app to protect personal data on cloud storage. 
It provides a secure, reliable, scalable, distributed file encryption method for clients to encrypt their files before they upload them to clouds.
User can sign in with their own cloud storage account and upload their file in any format through their mobile app. 
This mechanism would slice the file into fragments, and add data redundancy for recovering lost data. 
These data fragments will be encrypted and uploaded to the cloud storage. 
The outcome of the mechanism provides a secure, private and anonymous cloud storage for user data.
